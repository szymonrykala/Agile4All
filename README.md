- `./build` builds docker images
- `./push` pushes images to the registry
- `./start` runs application in production environment
- `./start-dev` runs application in development environment
- `./compose` wrapper to `docker compose` which sets up production environment variables & does other cool stuff
- `./compose-dev` same as `./compose` but instead of production it loads development environment variables
