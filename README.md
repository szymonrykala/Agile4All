- `./build` builds docker images
- `./push` pushes images to the registry
- `./start` runs application in production environment
- `./start-dev` runs application in development environment
- `./compose` wrapper to `docker compose` which sets up production environment variables & does other cool stuff
- `./compose-dev` same as `./compose` but instead of production it loads development environment variables
- `./dotnet-ef` dotnet-ef tool used for migrations. You can create migrations outside of docker too. But its nice to have ability to do that in docker. Eg. `./dotnet-ef migrations add InitialMigration --project /backend/AgileApp`
- `./generate-migration-scripts` used to generate `.sql` files from existing .NET migrations
